Also in similar times i do search about ai and stuff have finetuned on gpt api where i have a table and i will be sending i want to filter all students who are from Delhi and have cgpa more than 8 and are good in react
It will give response with some code which will be executed in some set of block which will show table after applying all filters it will give data in same variable which we used at time of training...
Also in free time i do some web extraction like extracting some data playing with dom elements doing creating web extensions for some taks one example is getting stock options price data to create history data of index option chain by extracting data from some websites and then posting it to api which will store it in mongodb, it's pretty easy and fun to do.
